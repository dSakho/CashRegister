# Cash Register
Mimics a cash register in a normal store. The goal here is to convert the Cash Register application you've created that prompts a user for some input, and turn it into a web application that exposes functionality that is capable of handling fetching data as well as manipulating and mutating data.

## Pull down this repository with Git
You may or may not have `Git` installed on your machine. Run `make tools` to see if you do.
And if you do, then
```
git clone https://github.com/dSakho/CashRegister.git
```

### Drop Wizard
This applications main dependency in the `pom.xml` file is the `dropwizard-core` dependency. 
[DropWizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.12/docs/index.html) is a set of Java libraries that make it easy to build and develop RESTful web services. 
With DropWizard you get a ton of production ready features for free out-of-the-box. 
Stuff such as
* An embadded HTTP web server (Jetty)
* Jersey for REST
* Jackson for JSON
* Metrics
* Logging
* Health Check
* Administrator Port
Please check out the documentation as well since this is also my first DropWizard application :D.

### RESTful Web Services (That Fire)
RESTful web services allow functionality of programs to be exposed over the web through HTTP.

### Make File 
Makefiles are a great place to start when you enter a brand new repo. All the words that precede a `:` are known as _targets_.  Make targets are commands that you can run in a shell that help ease complex commands required for local development. [Here]([https://blog.jayway.com/2017/03/12/short-introduction-makefiles/](https://blog.jayway.com/2017/03/12/short-introduction-makefiles/)) is a quick intro to make files. Please View the Makefile in this repository to view what things you will need to run this app through the terminal.
  

### File System Layout
Noticed how much your project has grown since you gave it to me. It now uses Apache Maven as a build tool to not only manage dependencies but to also assist in running your project with plugins and automation. Every Maven project has a top-level `pom.xml` file which lists the dependencies that are needed to run the application and bundles everything for you.

## But What About Eclipse...
Our goal is to get this application deployed to a service in the cloud that will have it run it for us. For that to happen, you need to get comfortable with running applications from a terminal / CLI tool. However, you will still be editing your Java source files and configurations in an IDE. I already saw that you're utilizing Eclipse which is very popular and widely used today in the Java ecosystem. Here are some Eclipse IDE [Hot Keys](https://dzone.com/articles/top-30-eclipse-keyboard-shortcuts-for-java-program-1**) that we both should know :)
